<div class="seo-analysis-help hidden">
    
    <p class="desc-title">Make sure your title is explicit and contains your most important keywords.Be sure that each page has a unique title</p>
    
    <p class="desc-description">Meta descriptions allow you to influence how your web pages are described and displayed in search results.Ensure that your meta description is explicit and contains your most important keywords.Check your GoogleTM Webmaster Tools for any warning messages on duplicate meta descriptions.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-headings">Use your keywords in the headings and make sure the first level (H1) includes your most important keywords. Never duplicate your title tag content in your header tag.For more â€‹effective SEO, use only one H1 tag per page.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-keywords-cloud">This Keyword Cloud provides an idea of your most frequently recurring keywords. They are likely to be the keywords with the greatest probability of ranking high in the search engines.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-keywords-consistency">This table highlights the importance of being consistent with your use of keywords. To improve the chance of ranking high in search results with a specific keyword, you should use the most important keywords consistently in your content, title, description, H titles, internal links anchor text and backlinks anchor text.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-images">Alternative text describes your images so they can appear in GoogleTM Images search results.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-text-ratio">This page's ratio of text to HTML code is below 15 percent, this means that your website probably needs more text content.A ratio between 25 and 70 percent is ideal. When it goes beyond that, the page might run the risk of being considered spam.As long as the â€‹content is relevant and gives essential information, it is a plus to have more of it.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-gplus">Your website is missing a rel="Publisher" link to your Google+ Page. This type of authorship markup is great for your brand. It ensures that your company is featured in SERPs, as opposed to only individual authors as is common with rel="Author".</p>
    
    <p class="desc-inpage-links">Limit the number of links to 200 per page. Use Nofollow to optimize the juice that you want to pass to each link.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-broken-links">There are broken internal links on your site that need to be fixed.Broken links send users to non-existing web pages. They are bad for your site's usability, reputation and SEO. Take the time to replace or remove each one.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-www-resolve">Redirecting requests from a non-preferred domain is important because search engines consider URLs with and without "www" as two different websites.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-ip-canonicalization">To check this for your website, enter your IP address in the browser and see if your site loads with the IP address. Ideally, the IP should redirect to your website's URL or to a page from your website hosting provider.If it does not redirect, you should do an htaccess 301 redirect to make sure the IP does not get indexed.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-robots-txt">A robots.txt file allows you to restrict the access of search engine robots that crawl the web and it can prevent these robots from accessing specific directories and pages. It also specifies where the XML sitemap file is located.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-xml-sitemap">A sitemap lists URLs that are available for crawling and can include additional information like your site's latest updates, frequency of changes and importance of the URLs. This allows search engines to crawl the site more intelligently.It is also good practice to specify your sitemap's location in your robots.txt file.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-url-rewrite">Great! You have clean (user-friendly) URLs which do not contain query strings. Clean URLs are not only SEO-friendly but are also important for usability.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-url-underscore">While GoogleTM treats hyphens (these-are- hyphens) as word separators, it does not treat underscores as word separators.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-flash">Flash should only be used for specific enhancements. Although Flash content often looks nicer, it cannot be properly indexed by search engines. Avoid full Flash websites to maximize SEO.This advice also applies to AJAX.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-frames">Frames can cause problems on your web page because search engines will not crawl or index the content within them.
Avoid frames whenever possible and use a NoFrames tag if you must use them.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-expiration">Do you know that you can register your domain for up to 10 years? By doing so, you will show the world that you are serious about your business.</p>
    
    <p class="desc-mobile-render">The number of people using the Mobile Web is huge; over 75 percent of consumers have access to smartphones. Your website should look nice on the most popular mobile devices. Use an analytics tool to track mobile usage of your website.</p>

    <p class="desc-mobile-load-time">Try to load your website on a mobile device and measure the download time. If your website takes more than five seconds to download on a mobile device, you will lose 74 percent of your audience! Mobile usage is growing fast, especially in North America, where it will soon outpace desktop browsing usage. Make sure your site loads fast and that it looks nice on all types of mobile devices. Be sure to not use Flash, and keep photos and videos to a minimum.</p>

    <p class="desc-mobile-optimization">Optimize the mobile experience even further with the following options:Mobile CSS, Meta Viewport Tag, Apple Icon, Mobile Redirection, No Flash content.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-URL">Keep your URLs short and avoid long domain names when possible. A descriptive URL is better recognized by search engines. A user should be able to look at the address bar and make an accurate guess about the content of the page before reaching it (e.g., http://www.mysite.com/en/products). Keep in mind that URLs are also an important part of a comprehensive SEO strategy. Use clean URLs to make your site more "crawlable" by GoogleTM. Search for a good domain name. If no good names are available, consider a second hand domain. To prevent brand theft, you might consider trademarking your domain name.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-favicon">Make sure this favicon is consistent with your brand.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-custom-404-page">Take advantage of the opportunity to provide a beautiful 404 Error Page for your visitors.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-conversion-forms">Add a conversion form for repeat visitors. It could be used to sign up for a subscription, get an email address of a visitor or close an online sale. â€‹Converting visitors into prospects/clients is probably the most important goal for your website. After adding a conversion form to your site, it is important that you optimize your website to boost conversions.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-page-size">Two of the main reasons for an increase in page size are images and JavaScript files. Page size affects the speed of your website; try to keep your page size below 300 Kb. Use images with a small size and optimize their download with gzip.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-load-time">Slow page load time is one of the biggest complaints of web users. If the load time/Kb is short, it means your homepage is too big. If the load time/Kb is long, this could be due to a server problem, a network problem, poor code optimization (cache, Mysql queries, etc.), or a third-party issue (advertising codes, analytics codes, etc.). Site speed is becoming an important factor for ranking high in GoogleTM search results. Check out GoogleTM's developer tutorials for tips on how to to make your website run faster. Monitor your server and receive SMS alerts when your website is down with a website monitoring tool.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-language">Make sure your declared language is the same as the language detected by GoogleTM. Tips for multilingual websites: Define the language of the content in each page's HTML code. Specify the language code in the URL as well (e.g., "mywebsite.com/fr/mycontent.html").</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-printability">This is a special CSS style sheet which ensures that unnecessary interface designs and images are left out when printing pages from your site, saving the user a lot of ink. It is just another way to provide a rich user-experience. If you do not have a print style sheet yet, set one up.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-microformats">A microformat is a technical semantic markup that can be used to better structure the data submitted to search engines. Thanks to microformats, GoogleTM regularly improves its presentation of search results.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-domain-availability">Register the various extensions of your domain to protect your brand from cybersquatters.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-typo-availability">Register the various typos of your domain to protect your brand from cybersquatters.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-email-privacy">Malicious bots scrape the web in search of email addresses and plain text email addresses are more likely to be spammed.</p>

    <p class="desc-usability-spam-block">It is important that your SEO efforts are not tarnished by spammy activities. Take care to avoid forum and blog spam and use best practices when sharing your content. In addition, if you send email campaigns or transactional emails, use professional email software to keep your IP clean and improve the deliverability of your emails.</p>

    <p class="desc-technologies">Your server's IP address has little impact on your SEO. Nevertheless, try to host your website on a server which is geographically close to your visitors. Search engines take the geolocation of a server into account as well as the server speed. Use DNSstuff for comprehensive reports on your server. Get to know the technologies used for your website. Some codes might slow down your website.</p>

    <p class="desc-technologies-speed-tips">Website speed has a huge effect on SEO. â€‹Speed-up your website so search engines will reward you by sending more visitors. Also, conversion rates are far higher for websites that load faster than their slower competitors.</p>

    <p class="desc-technologies-analytics">Web analytics let you measure visitor activity on your website. You should have at least one analytics tool installed. It is also good to install one extra tool to have a confirmation of the results. Analytics Tools: GoogleTM Analytics, QuantcastTM, SiteCatalystTM, PiwikTM, chartbeatTM, ClickyTM, ClickTaleTM, etc.</p>

    <p class="desc-technologies-W3C-validity">Use valid markup that contains no errors. Syntax errors can make your page difficult for search engines to index. To find the detected errors, run the W3C validation service, or check Validator.nu to make sure you don't miss an error. W3C is a consortium that sets web standards.</p>

    <p class="desc-technologies-doctype">Declaring a doctype helps web browsers to render content correctly.</p>

    <p class="desc-technologies-encoding">Specifying language/character encoding can prevent problems with the rendering of special characters.</p>

    <p class="desc-social-shareability">The impact of social media is huge for certain industries, take advantage of this digital version of word-of-mouth marketing. Make sure you have opened â€‹social media profiles on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and other sites that are of interest to your customers. Learn how to engage your social media audiences and create a consistent fan base. You can also use your website to increase your popularity on social platforms. Check these helpful tools for managing your social media campaign.</p>

    <p class="desc-social-twitter-account">Twitter is a fast-growing social network. If possible, register a Twitter account in your brand's name now to prevent brandjacking.</p>

    <p class="desc-social-google+-page">Being active in this social network is important for claiming your brand, influencing your search engine rankings and interacting with your network. You might also consider managing your profile with Google My Business (formerly Google Places).</p>

    <p class="desc-local-directories">Take care of your listings in local directories; since maps are now an integral part of search results, your G+ Local page may have more visitors than your website! It is important to make sure that your business details are correct in each directory where you are listed. Find the directories in your country (USA, UK, Spain, France, Canada, Australia, Brazil, and India) and enhance your listings with pictures, video, schedules and as many customer reviews as possible.</p>
